Deadlock is a situation in multithreading where two or more threads are blocked forever,waiting for each
other to release a resource. This typically occurs when two or more threads have circular dependencies
on a set of Locks.


DeadLock typically occur when four condition are met simultaneously:


1.Mutual Exclusion: Only one thread can access a resource at a time
2.Hold and Wait: A thread holding at least one resource is waiting to accquire additional resources held
                 by other threads.

3. No preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from threads holding them.

4. Circular Wait: A set of threads waiting for each other in circular chain
