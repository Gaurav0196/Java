In multithreaded environment,thread often need to communicate and coordinate withe each other
to accomplish a task.

Without proper communication mechanism ,threads might end up in inefficient busy-waiting state,
leading to wastage of CPU resources and potential deadlocks.


methods for interThread communication:
These methods can only be called within synchronized context

1. wait()-> tells current thread to release the lock and wait until some other thread runs notify or notifyall
2.notify()-> wakes up a single thread that is waiting
3.notifyall()-> wakes up all thread that are waiting


// Thread Safety:-Whenever multiple threads tries to access an object in java and there is no wrong data
or race condition occurring  then we can call tha t object thread safe.
